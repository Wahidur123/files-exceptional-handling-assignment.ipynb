This is especially noticeable in long-running applications, where garbage collection cycles can temporarily halt the program’s execution.\n","\n","**Memory Leaks:**\n","\n","If objects are not properly dereferenced, they may not be garbage collected, leading to memory leaks. This can happen in cases where objects are inadvertently retained, such as through lingering references in global variables, caches, or circular references.\n","\n","**Large Objects and Memory Efficiency:**\n","\n","Handling large data structures (e.g., large lists or dictionaries) can be inefficient, particularly when data is copied rather than referenced.
